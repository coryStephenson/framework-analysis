  abstract  = "Organizations know that investing in security measures is an
               important requirement for doing business. But how much should
               they invest and how should those investments be directed? Many
               organizations have turned to a risk management approach to
               identify the largest threats and the control measures that could
               help mitigate those threats. This research presents the Cost of
               IT Security (CITS) Framework to support analysis of the costs
               and benefits of those control measures. This analysis can be
               performed by using either quantification methods or by using a
               qualitative approach. Based on a study of five distinct security
               areas--Identity Management, Network Access Control, Intrusion
               Detection Systems, Business Continuity Management and Data Loss
               Prevention--nine cost factors are identified for IT security,
               and for only five of those nine a quantitative approach is
               feasible for the cost factor. This study finds that even though
               quantification methods are useful, organizations that wish to
               use those should do this together with more qualitative
               approaches in the decision-making process for security measures.",
